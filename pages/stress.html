            <h1>Managing stress/Overcoming stress</h1>
            <p>Not all stress is bad, as one might think. There are two types of stress, distress and eustress. Distress is the “bad stress”, and it is what most people think of when they hear the word “stress”. Conversely, eustress is the “good stress”, and it is lesser known. </p>
            <p>One official definition of eustress is, “a positive form of stress having a beneficial effect on health, motivation, performance, and emotional well-being”(Merriam-Webster). So while distress can cause anxiety and an overall negative impact on your well-being, eustress helps your well-being.</p>

            <p>Eustress isn't merely a fleeting sensation; it's a force for improvement across various aspects of life. From the boardroom to the gym, its effects are palpable. Consider athletes preparing for a major competition. While the pressure may be immense, it's this very pressure that drives them to push their limits and achieve greatness.</p>
            <p>But eustress isn't confined to high-stakes situations. Even everyday challenges can elicit this positive form of stress. Whether it's tackling a new project at work or embarking on a spontaneous road trip, eustress thrives in the face of novelty and opportunity.</p>
